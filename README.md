# Density ![tests_312](https://github.com/microprediction/density/workflows/tests_312/badge.svg)
A simple `dict` specification of univariate density functions, with pydantic checking. These can subsequently be evaluated by the [densitypdf](or use the [densitypdf](https://github.com/microprediction/densitypdf) package. 

## Install

   pip install density 
   
## Specifying densities or mixtures of the same
See [examples](https://github.com/microprediction/density/tree/main/examples) of specifying densities. 

See the [Scipy manifest](https://github.com/microprediction/density/blob/main/density/schemachecker/scipydensitymanifest.py) for a list of densities. 

## Evaluating densities 
See [https://github.com/microprediction/density](https://github.com/microprediction/densitypdf)

You can also evaluate manually, per [here](https://github.com/microprediction/density/tree/main/examples/evaluation)
